# react-cornerstone-viewport
- This is a fork of [react-cornerstone-viewport](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/react-cornerstone-viewport)
- The original fork is no longer maintained, so we forked it to publish to [private GitHub Packages](https://github.com/altis-labs/react-cornerstone-viewport/pkgs/npm/react-cornerstone-viewport)
- We will continue to maintain this fork as required

## Tips
```bash

# create personal access token with read:packages
# note: can't use "gh auth token" or fine-grained since private packages not supported

# set npm auth token
export NPM_TOKEN=<token>

# install
npm i

# build
npm run build

# publish
npm publish
```
